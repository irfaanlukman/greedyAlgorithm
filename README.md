In this Problem set 1; assignment 2 we were tasked to recreate a greedy algorithm in order to optimize change given in coins.

The concept of the greedy algorithm is to give out as little coins as possible in change.

Utilizing get_float and do while loops to carry out this task, it was a simple yet tricky assignment as it was imperative to round the change to the nearest 2 decimal places using round(change * 100), in order to avoid the float imprecision problem.
